prompt is:

You bought a home filled with cutting edge technology, including a helpful 'smart A.I.' that can do just about anything you ask them to. 
Unbeknownst to you, there actually is no A.I, the house is just haunted by a really helpful spirit, and they are posing as a program so they don't scare you.

The time has come for my biggest accomplishment.I finally got the keys to my new house,It was on sale due to people selling it out of fear of a program or something.The program claims to be a smart A.I. that does anything for me i see it as something very helpful.It cleans my house for me when im gone but i feel like it has a deeper darker story behind it.

One day the A.I gave me its name directly; It said its name was Jarvis. I'm not sure why it suddenly wanted to indroduce itself after I've already moved in. It claims it was made by owner a long time ago, but the program was abandoned when his programmer never returned to the house. Since then, a lot of people have moved in, but then the same thing as the programmer. It has never introduced itself to anyone else, it wants me to not leave it like how so many other have.
