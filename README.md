prompt is:

You bought a home filled with cutting edge technology, including a helpful 'smart A.I.' that can do just about anything you ask them to. 
Unbeknownst to you, there actually is no A.I, the house is just haunted by a really helpful spirit, and they are posing as a program so they don't scare you.

The time has come for my biggest accomplishment.I finally got the keys to my new house,It was on sale due to people selling it out of fear of a program or something.The program claims to be a smart A.I. that does anything for me i see it as something very helpful.It cleans my house for me when im gone but i feel like it has a deeper darker story behind it.

I've tried getting home early when I give it the command to clean the house, but everything for the most part appears normal: the program will greet me, ask me how my day was, and remind me of what all I need to do. But one time, I looked through the window before entering and found something I couldn't comprehend. I saw my dishes floating around, getting washed and put into the dishwasher.

I stood there in disbelief: I figured there was maybe some sort of robot who hid while I was there to do things while I was gone, but surely no program was capable of these sort of telekinetic powers, no matter how "smart" they were. I watched the thing work silently for a while, watching all my dishes floating around, somehow not breaking in the process. When it was done, I decided to go in and confront it about what I saw.
